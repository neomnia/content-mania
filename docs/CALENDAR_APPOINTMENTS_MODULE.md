// Decrypt when needed
const accessToken = await decrypt(encryptedToken)
```

### State Parameter

OAuth flows use encrypted state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks:

```typescript
const stateData = JSON.stringify({
  userId: user.userId,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
})
const state = await encrypt(stateData)
```

## Lago Integration

Paid appointments integrate with Lago for invoicing:

1. User creates a paid appointment
2. User clicks "Create Invoice"
3. System calls Lago API to create invoice
4. Invoice ID stored in appointment
5. Payment status updated on webhook

### Webhook Handler

The Lago webhook at `/api/lago-webhook` handles payment confirmations and updates the appointment payment status.

## Testing

### Create a Test Appointment

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/appointments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=your_token" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Appointment",
    "startTime": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
    "type": "free"
  }'
```

### Test Calendar Connection

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/calendar/settings`
2. Click "Connect" for Google or Microsoft
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Verify connection appears as active

## Dependencies

```bash
npm install react-big-calendar date-fns googleapis @azure/msal-react
```

Note: `googleapis` is optional if only using fetch-based implementation.

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Errors

- **state_expired**: User took too long, restart OAuth flow
- **invalid_state**: State verification failed, check encryption
- **access_denied**: User denied permissions

### Sync Issues

- Check token expiration and refresh logic
- Verify calendar permissions
- Check API rate limits

### Payment Issues

- Verify Lago API key configuration
- Check customer exists in Lago
- Review webhook configuration
